This is an educational project to enhance the ability to make a more logical and easier JS code using VueJS.


The game is pretty simple. Player has 4 decision to slay the monster:
	1. attack: simple attack which is weaker than monster's atack
	2. special attack : stronger attack than monster.
	3. heal : recover +10 health
	4. give up : give up the game.
the damage of both player and monster is randomly choosen. but monster is stronger than you. so you should use either special attack or heal to slay the monster.
